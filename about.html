      <h2>I'm published!</h2>
      <p>Toolbox is the project I worked on at Vectorform.</p>
      <br>
      <p>We worked on toolbox for almost a year.&nbsp&nbsp It was a fantastic experience at a fantastic company.&nbsp&nbsp Vectorform was amazing and everyone there is very good at what they do.&nbsp&nbsp If you get the app I should still be in the credits!&nbsp&nbsp It's in the Windows store <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/toolbox-for-windows-8/9wzdncrfjb05">here.</a></p>

      <p>Working at Infinite Machine was the best part of my time at LTU.&nbsp&nbsp It was a ton of work and a ton of fun and I'm proud to have been part of the team.&nbsp&nbsp After entering our game, Paper Dream, into the 2014 college game competition, we were invited out to California to show it off as finalists in the competition.</p>

      <p>We didn't win but we definitely learned a lot.</p>
      <br>
      <p>VICA (Now SkillsUSA) was a statewide vocational competition where thousands of high school students from all across Michigan met in one place to see who had learned the most in their respective fields.&nbsp&nbsp My teammate and I placed second and still had an awesome time.</p>

      <h2>I got hitched</h2>
      <p>Definitely the craziest thing I've done after college.</p>
      <br>
      <p>We met online through OkayCupid in June of 2012 and haven't looked back since.&nbsp&nbsp She's the best part of my life and everything I do is for her.</p>

      <br>
      <p>I started playing drums in high school as a way to make friends and then got into guitar later on in college.&nbsp&nbsp My wife was the opposite, she took band very seriously all through high school, but decided to follow another path in college.&nbsp&nbsp I'm looking forward to her and I jamming together one day when we have a place with a basement and room to be loud.</p>

      <p>Fishing isn't something I ordinarily do; I don't own a rod, a reel, a lure, or a net.&nbsp&nbsp But when my dad and my brother and I go to Canada for a fishing trip, you can bet I'm going to be up there at it just as hard as them!&nbsp&nbsp My dad started taking us when we were younger and we still try to go if we can.</p>
