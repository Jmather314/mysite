      <h1>Justin Mather</h1>
      <p>Hi there!&nbsp&nbsp I'm Justin and welcome to my web and UI resume.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I love boxes!&nbsp&nbsp That's important in the web and ui world.&nbsp&nbsp You'd be amazed how many boxes you interact with on a regular basis everyday.&nbsp&nbsp Probably thousands.&nbsp&nbsp Thousands of different squares and rectangles thoughtfully placed and working just below the surface.&nbsp&nbsp You might not even know that they're there, and yet your experience as a user depends on them.&nbsp&nbsp Those boxes are busy doing something, something important.&nbsp&nbsp They hold our digital lives together like dark matter surrounding our galaxy...</p>
      <br>
      <p>Anyway, I'm a nerd, I love space and science in general.&nbsp&nbsp I also dig video games and movies and have a wicked sense of humor.&nbsp&nbsp I'm so hirable it's insane!</p>
